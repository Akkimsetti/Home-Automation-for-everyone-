# Home-Automation-for-everyone

### Materials Required:
- Nodemcu
- 5v Relay
- Jumper Wires
- Connecting Wires
- Soldering Iron
- Arduino IDE
- IFTTT

We can embed Google assistant to control our appliances in our home. The Google assistant commands can be sent to Nodemcu Microcontroller using ESP8266 WiFi module. Then by processing the commands received Nodemcu can switch ON or OFF the relay present in the circuit. Thus the Bulb glows On or OFF
